# ufw status verbose

# ufw disable
# ufw default deny incoming
# ufw default allow outgoing
# ufw app list
# ufw app info "Nginx HTTP"
Enable Application Profiles
# ufw allow "OpenSSH"
# ufw allow "Apache Full"

UFW is now ready-to-use for our test case. Let’s enable it and check its status:
# ufw enable

# ufw status verbose


# tail -f /var/log/ufw.log

using nmap to scan the server ports from a computer outside the server’s network:
nmap  nmap 3.83.227.12
output:
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-20 15:18 WAT
Nmap scan report for ec2-3-83-227-12.compute-1.amazonaws.com (3.83.227.12)
Host is up (0.24s latency).

# ufw logging off

List All Rules and Delete a Rule
ufw status numbered

Output:

     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] Apache Full                ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  
[ 2] OpenSSH                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  
[ 3] Apache Full (v6)           ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)             
[ 4] OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6) 

In this case, we can, for example, eliminate rules 3 and 4 since we’re not using IPv6. But there isn’t a function to remove multiple rules at once, so we must remove one rule at a time. We should be careful to remove the rules from the highest number to the lowest, so the other rules won’t change after the deletion:
